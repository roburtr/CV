          I am currently working as an electrical engineer @ <a href="https://www.russellfinex.com/en/">Russell Finex Ltd</a>, with an activity that
          involves, amongst other things, programming of microcoltrollers. I am
          looking to change the path of my career and become a Full Stack developer
          and find a job that will allow me to work entirely remote. </p>
